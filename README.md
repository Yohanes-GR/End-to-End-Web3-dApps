### Introduction
Web3 is the stack of protocols that enable fully decentralized applications. Web3 technology is inherently about the user controlled internet. It is being achieved by a growing stack of decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, oracles, crypto wallets, storage networks, and more.

### Objective of the Project
This project tries to enable clients to be able to solve the challenges ensuring that certificates are available to all trainees in a secure way, and (if possible) that certificate holders can benefit from smart contract actions now and in the future. At present, certificates are distributed as simple PDF files, without the ability to verify their authenticity nor can trainer undertake smart actions with the trainees/their contracts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BirhanuGebisa/Algorand-dapps_smart-contract.git
cd algorand-NFTs-smartContracts
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
